This is a demo repository for the 
[JavaScript for Shiny Users workshop][js4shiny] at 
[rstudio::conf][js4rsconf].

The goal is to build an [htmlwidget]
around the [Frappe Charts][frappe-charts] JavaScript library.

The repository is itself a walk through of the project.
Walk through the 
[commit log](https://github.com/gadenbuie/js4shiny-frappeCharts/commits/master)
or read through the 
[dev journal](https://github.com/gadenbuie/js4shiny-frappeCharts/blob/master/dev/dev.md)
to explore the project and the changes made at each step of the process.
